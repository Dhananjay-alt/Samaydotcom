#Samay.com ⏳

-The decentralized protocol where Minutes are Money.

-The Concept: We are tokenizing the world's scarcest asset—Time—by allowing anyone to mint      their schedule as tradeable ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.

-Better than Web2: Unlike Time.fun, Samay leverages Ethereum's composability, meaning a         creator's "Time Token" can be used as collateral in DeFi, swapped on Uniswap, or staked for    yield.

-Bonding Curves: Prices are determined by an algorithmic bonding curve; as demand for a         person's time rises, the cost of their next "minute" automatically increases.

-True Ownership: Creators retain self-sovereignty over their clock; no centralized admin can     freeze your calendar or seize your accrued value.

-Redemption Mechanism: Holders can burn tokens to claim real-world interactions (1:1 calls,     code reviews, or mentorship) via verifiable on-chain events.

-Speculation Meets Utility: Users can invest early in high-potential individuals (e.g., a       junior dev) and profit as their time becomes more valuable over their career.

-The "Samay" Standard: We are building a universal interface where "1 SAMAY" represents a       standardized unit of attention, interoperable across dApps.

-Governance: High-volume holders gain governance rights over a creator's dedicated "Community   Hours," voting on how that time is spent.

-Layer 2 Ready: Optimized for L2s (like Base or Arbitrum) to ensure that trading minutes         doesn't cost hours in gas fees.

The Vision: Moving beyond the gig economy to the Time Economy, where every second is liquid, tradeable, and transparent.
